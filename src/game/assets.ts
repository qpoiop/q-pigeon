 * so the existing procedural `animBird` drives them unchanged — no skeletal
 * clips required. Until a model is registered in MODELS this is inert and the
 * game keeps using the procedural `makeBird`, so shipping this is zero-risk.
 *
 * The heavy loaders are dynamically imported the first time a model is actually
 * requested, so they add nothing to the main bundle while MODELS is empty.
